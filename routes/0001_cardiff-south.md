<!-- # The Route -->

![Map view of the route](/assets/img/routes/0001/map.png){:style="display:block; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto"}

Starting on the corner of Gertrude Street and Haddington Drive, we'll avoid the main roads and loop our way via Knight Street and Killara Drive, finishing with a gentle roll down Beeson Street to the crossing outside the main gate.

The total length is 2.0km. This being Cardiff South it is all on road, with a small grass section to avoid traffic. There's a couple of short steep sections, and one climb briefly hits 13% grade. There's no points for coming first and we'll take our time, stopping to cross Crockett Street safely, and enjoy the ride.

We ride every **Wednesday morning in term, leaving the starting point at 8:15am**. At around 10km/h, we'll arrive at school by play bell time at 8:30am.

Feel free to join in at any point along the route - there are no planned stops (other than the safety crossing at Crockett) but if you let us know you're coming we can steer the bus your way.

In case of typhoon or other potentially ruinous event, check WhatsApp for up to date plans.

</div>

##### What ages can join the bus?

Anyone you can move at a slow cycling pace (10km/h) is welcome. Preschoolers in a bike trailer, puppies in a basket, year 6'ers on BMX and 10 year olds on a scooter are all welcome. As long as we can keep them safe, there's a spot on the bus.

##### Do I need a bike?

You and your children need a human-propelled way to keep up with the bus. Cargo bikes, BMX, scooters, e-bikes, recumbents, bike trailers, tag-a-longs, mountain bikes with pegs and shocks are lucky, and all welcome.

##### Who keeps the kids safe?

You, a responsible adult, are responsible for anyone you put on the bus. Either accompany them on the ride, or put them in the care of someone you trust. The bus will not run unless the riders are safe, and riders without responsible supervision are not safe.

##### Is the bus safe?

All road use entails risk, but participant safety is paramount. Every bus has at least one leader, wearing high-vis clothing, who is coached on ensuring we're as safe as practical. All participants are expected to follow the road rules, including keeping left and giving way. Those that don't follow the rules are not welcome on the bus.

The route has been risk assessed and risky movements, such as turning right or crossing roads, have an execution plan to minimise risk. The route itself is designed to minimise risky interactions, and residual risks such as crossing Crockett Street, have a protocol to ensure they are as safe as practical.

##### Can I ride an e-bike?

Absolutely. Just ensure it is legal. In NSW a good check is to ensure it is not propelled unless it is being pedalled. Any illegal vehicles will be excluded from the bus.

I'm Heath Raftery. I moved to Cardiff South in 2023 and our two little girls started at Tilly's. My little big girl started Preschool at Cardiff South in 2024, and this year both girls will join the Cardiff South family. We're delighted to have found our community, the school and the connections we've made.

The kids and I love riding "the chariot" to school. It's a joy we'd love to share with others.
