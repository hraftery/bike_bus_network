        A **Bike Bus** is simply a group of families riding to school together along a regular route.
        Around the world communities are discovering the joy and positivity this simple act brings.
        [This short video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zNOb377piC8) paints a thousand words.
        <br><br>
        The concept was popularised in the USA by one man, Sam Balto, who created [Bike Bus World](https://bikebus.world/).
        The Bike Bus Network is heavily influenced by his work, and Sam's website is a great place to start your learning.
